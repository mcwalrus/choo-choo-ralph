> **🧪 Experimental** — This workflow is actively tested on real projects. Smaller, verified tasks trade higher agent usage for more reliable outcomes. Your mileage may vary—I'd love feedback on what works and what doesn't.

## What is Choo Choo Ralph?

A [pi.dev](https://pi.dev) package that turns your plans into autonomous, verified work—designed for teams, not just side projects.

Most Ralph implementations use GitHub Issues (latency), scattered markdown files (messy), or monolithic JSON (doesn't scale). Choo Choo Ralph uses [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)—a git-native task tracker where every task has an ID, workflows have real dependencies, and everything syncs through git the way your team already works.

**The thesis**: Simple loop + structured workflows + persistent memory = autonomous coding that actually works.

---

## The Workflow

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   1. Plan   │ ──▶ │  2. Spec    │ ──▶ │  3. Pour    │ ──▶ │  4. Ralph   │ ──▶ │ 5. Harvest  │
│    (you)    │     │  (you + AI) │     │    (AI)     │     │    (AI)     │     │ (you + AI)  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

1. **Plan** — Write what you want to build (this part is yours)
2. **Spec** — AI transforms it into structured tasks; you review
3. **Pour** — Tasks become beads with workflows and dependencies
4. **Ralph** — The loop runs autonomously until done
5. **Harvest** — Extract learnings into skills, docs, or CLAUDE.md

---

## What You Get

- **Verified, not vibes** — Health checks before implementing, tests after, browser verification when needed
- **Team-friendly** — Git-native sync, no API latency, works with how your team already collaborates
- **Traceable** — Bead IDs link commits to tasks, learnings to work. Full history of what happened where.
- **Structured phases** — Bearings → Implement → Verify → Commit (not just "do the thing")
- **Bounded context** — Each task carries its own history via [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), no context window bloat
- **Compounding knowledge** — Agents capture learnings as they work; harvest them into skills and docs that make future sessions smarter
- **Customizable workflows** — Formulas and scripts are yours to modify, not hardcoded decisions

---

## Quick Start

<details>
<summary>⚠️ <strong>Safety Warning</strong> — Read before running</summary>

Ralph runs `pi` non-interactively in `-p`/print mode, which allows it to execute commands without confirmation. This is powerful but risky.

**We strongly recommend:**
- Run in a **Docker container** or **VM**
- Use a machine that doesn't have your life's work on it
- Start with small, low-risk tasks until you trust the setup
- Review the formulas and scripts before running

By using this project, you accept full responsibility for any consequences.

</details>

**Prerequisites:** [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd` command), [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/), and [pi](https://pi.dev)

```bash
# Install package (see "Installing for pi" below for global vs local)
pi install git:github.com/mcwalrus/choo-choo-ralph

# Set up project (invokes the install skill)
pi -p "install choo-choo-ralph in this project"

# Generate spec from your plan
pi -p "/spec plans/my-feature.md"

# Review the spec, then pour into beads
pi -p "/pour"

# Start the loop
./ralph.sh
```

For the complete workflow, see [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md).

### Installing for pi

`pi install` supports two scopes — pick based on whether you want Ralph everywhere or just in one repo.

| | Global | Local (`-l` / `--local`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Command** | `pi install git:github.com/mcwalrus/choo-choo-ralph` | `pi install git:github.com/mcwalrus/choo-choo-ralph -l` |
| **Registered in** | `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` | `./.pi/settings.json` (project) |
| **Available in** | Every project you run `pi` in | Only this repo |
| **Good for** | Your own machine, personal workflow | Teams — commit `.pi/settings.json` so every contributor gets the same skills/prompts automatically |
| **Collisions** | Shadowed by any project-local package with the same skill/prompt name (project scope always wins) | None — scoped to the repo |
| **Trust** | Installed explicitly by you once | Other contributors must approve project-local packages the first time (`pi install -a` / `--approve`), since a checked-in `.pi/settings.json` can point at arbitrary code |
| **Updating** | `pi update git:github.com/mcwalrus/choo-choo-ralph` on your machine | Same command, but per-clone — everyone updates independently unless you re-commit a version bump |

Either way, `pi list` shows what's currently installed and where, and `pi remove <source>` (add `-l` for the local copy) uninstalls it.

## The Problem

Most autonomous coding setups fall into two traps:

1. **Too simple** — Run an agent in a loop, hope for the best, watch it spiral when something breaks
2. **Too complex** — Build elaborate orchestration that's harder to debug than the code it writes

And most Ralph implementations work fine for side projects but break down for teams. GitHub Issues introduce API latency. Scattered markdown files don't scale. Big JSON files or progress trackers get clunky when multiple people are involved.

Choo Choo Ralph is designed for real teams. The outer loop is dead simple. The workflow inside each task is structured and verified. Every task has an ID that traces through to commits and learnings. And everything syncs through git—no extra infrastructure.

---

## Why Beads?

Choo Choo Ralph requires [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads). Here's why it's worth adding to your stack:

**Solves the team problem** — Beads syncs via git, not APIs. No rate limits, no latency, no network errors when agents update tasks. Works with how your team already collaborates.

**Structured workflows, not checklists** — Molecules define multi-step workflows with real dependencies. Agents follow the structure instead of winging it.

**Traceability** — Every bead has an ID. Link commits to tasks, learnings to specific work. When something goes wrong (or right), you know where it came from.

**Bounded context** — Each bead carries its own history. Context stays contained instead of growing unbounded across sessions.

**Clean abstraction** — All the organizational work is behind `bd` commands. No cluttering your codebase with planning files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Beads is a **hard requirement**. The plugin's pour and formula system depends on Beads' molecule feature to create multi-step workflows.

## Compounding Knowledge

Every task teaches your agents something. The question is: do you capture it?

```
Iteration 1: Write code → Discover patterns → Capture as comments
Iteration 2: Write code → Learn from previous → Capture new insights
Iteration 3: Harvest learnings → Create skills/docs → Future agents are smarter
Iteration 4: New agent benefits from skills → Works faster → Discovers more
...repeat...
```

**The flywheel:**
1. **Code** — Each task produces working, tested, committed code
2. **Memory** — Agents capture gaps and learnings as comments on beads
3. **Harvest** — You extract valuable patterns into skills, CLAUDE.md, docs
4. **Compound** — Future iterations benefit from accumulated knowledge
5. **Repeat** — The system gets smarter with every session

Run `/harvest` after a session to gather learnings and propose documentation artifacts.

---

## Customization

When you install (see "Installing for pi" above), you get local copies of everything—shell scripts, formulas, and config. These are yours to modify.

This is intentional. We didn't want a CLI with hardcoded decisions. We wanted best practices as a starting point that you can adapt per-project. One project might need tweaked prompts; another works fine with defaults.

**What you can customize:**
- **Shell scripts** (`ralph.sh`, `ralph-once.sh`) — Loop behavior, task limits, output formatting
- **Formulas** (`.beads/formulas/`) — Workflow steps, prompts, verification requirements
- **Specs** (`.choo-choo-ralph/`) — Your planning and review process

For details, see [docs/customization.md](docs/customization.md).

## Why "Choo Choo Ralph"?

**Choo Choo** — Like a train with carts. Each cart is a containerized block of work—self-contained, carrying its own context and history. The train keeps moving forward, cart after cart, toward your destination.

**Ralph** — Named after the [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/): run an AI in a loop until it's done. Simple, relentless, surprisingly effective. Ralph makes mistakes, gets confused, but never stops trying.
